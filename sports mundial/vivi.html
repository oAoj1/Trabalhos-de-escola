		Andrea Lee impressed in the beginning of the first round. The American landed a jab right on Viviane Araújo and, when the latter got up, landed a nice high kick that almost gave final numbers to the fight. Surprisingly, the Brazilian quickly recovered and landed a beautiful fall on her opponent. Next, it was Vivi's turn to land a punch that destabilized Lee. Confident, the 'Cerrado MMA' athlete dropped her opponent and distributed punches in an attempt to reduce the damage.

		In the second round, Viviane ignored the scare of the previous partial, went on the attack and dominated her opponent. Standing, the Brazilian was superior and even applied a clean blow on Lee's waistline. On the ground, the veteran tried four finishes, could not close the duel, but punished the American based on the 'ground and pound'.

		In the third round, Vivi dropped Lee in the beginning and scored on the ground. Tired, the American couldn't take any more danger to her opponent and became easy prey. With one more fall, the Brazilian controlled her opponent. At the end of the 15 minutes of fight, the judges gave the victory to Viviane by unanimous decision.
