			<h1>Auction of the shirt worn by Maradona in "the hand of God" match</h1>
			<h2>The shirt worn by Maradona in the famous match of "the hand of God" and "the goal of the century"</h2>

			<p>The shirt worn by Maradona in the famous match of "the hand of God" and "the goal of the century" goals against England has been auctioned by Sotheby's in London. The shirt was previously in the possession of former player Steve Hodge, due to an exchange he made with Maradona after the match.</p>

			<p>
			The first offer was for £4 million, but speculation was as high as £6 million. 
			Sold to an anonymous buyer for £ 7,142,500, the star's family, before the sale, said that the shirt that was being auctioned was not the one of the second half, where there were goals, but the first half, which ended without any goal.</p>

			 The auction house rebutted Maradona's daughter, who shared a sentence that her father told her about the shirt, saying that the one being auctioned was
			 indeed the one used to score the two goals.
			 </p>

			 <p>
			Before this auction, the most expensive shirt to be auctioned had been Pele's from the 1970 World Cup final for £157,000, according to Guinness World 
			Records.
