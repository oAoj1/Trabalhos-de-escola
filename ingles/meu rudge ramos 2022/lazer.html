			<h2>Parque Salvador Arena</h2>
			<p>Inaugurated on 18 December 2005, the Engenheiro Salvador Arena Park offers a children's playground, walking track, exercise area, fountain, artificial waterfall, snack bar, theatre, sound system that reproduces ambient music and a freshwater aquarium, which is the park's great attraction, with various species of fish, including carp and kingio.
			A good part of its construction was developed with direct labour from the municipal administration and its landscaping project follows the architectural pattern of a park in the same municipality, but located on another avenue and neighbourhood.
			The park is named after the engineer Salvador Arena, who contributed to the social and educational development of São Bernardo do Campo.

			<h2>Praça dos Meninos</h2>
			<p>Inaugurated on 23 December 1975 by Mayor Geraldo Faria Rodrigues. With a Japanese style, the square offers a bridge, which follows oriental patterns, playground, car park, bandstand and stretching equipment.
			For many years, the square was the attraction of Rudge, even serving as the setting for a commercial in the late 80's, besides being the scenery for family and newly-wed pictures.
			In the 90s, the square received fences and began to operate with pre-established hours, and in 2011 got a night market, which takes place until today.

			<h2>Teatro Lauro Gomes</h2>
			<p>It was built in 1962, as an amphitheater annex to the Otílio de Oliveira School Group, and in the 1990's it became a municipal cultural device and underwent a great reform.
			It is the stage for plays, concerts and presentations by the São Bernardo Philharmonic Orchestra.  It has already received the singers Zélia Duncan and Jorge Vercillo, and shows like 'Show da Luna' and 'O Pai' with Fúlvio Stefanini.
